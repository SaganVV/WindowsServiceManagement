# WindowsServiceManagement

## Description ##
Welcome to the Windows Service Management project, which aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to manage Windows services. This implementation features a custom COM object built using C++ ATL, allowing for basic service operations. For this project, I chose to build a C# GUI due to its simplicity and flexibility. Although not a C# expert, I am continuously working on improving the code and adding more features as I gain more experience with the language.

## Future Plans ##
* Adding support for more advanced service management tasks
* Refactoring the existing code to improve performance and readability
* Splitting the existing interface into multiple interfaces to improve maintainability
